                Sooo, christmas, right? I'm writing it still in november lol but want to do
                that now because I would forget later for sure
                I didn't know what I could get you so I thought about making a site again but
                this time making it a bit more better.
                Since it's christmas I want to wish u again everything that's best, for you to get
                better and for us to have a great time.
                You have changed actually a lot, don't know if you'll see that by then but I do
                and I'm proud of you because of that ‚ù§.
                I would like to get you a present on this christmas but you'll again probs say "don't 
                spend any money on me" so yea
                I have a limited choice haha. That's why I'm making this site and doing it in november
                so I can think of some thing I can a add and make it a bit better. For now the site looks
                like shit so I hope I can make it look better by christmas heh.
                Btw I should mention it is mainly for you Reze but also since it's christmas it's also for
                everyone there. For now I met Megan, Amber, Amy and Aiko (yes, yes Princess-Aiko I know lol).
                Since I know them I also want to wish you happy christmas and to not make yours and  Reze's life
                miserable. That's not important today tho, what's important is that I could make this 
                site for you and maybe spend a bit of time together. So again happy christmas to all of you.
                One thing I want to say specifically to Reze (mby first time in life lol) love ya ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ :3.
                Take care of yourself and have a decent day lol. <3<3<3<3<3<3.
