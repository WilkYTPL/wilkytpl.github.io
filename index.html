                  care at least a bit about others so my request is to take a particullary 
                  good care of both of them if I'm not around. Make sure that they're not tired,
                  hungry or anything. Thank you in advance lol.

                Sooo, christmas, right? I'm writing it still in november lol but want to do
                that now because I would forget later for sure
                I didn't know what I could get you so I thought about making a site again but
                this time making it a bit more better.
                Since it's christmas I want to wish u again everything that's best, for you to get
                better and for us to have a great time.
                You have changed actually a lot, don't know if you'll see that by then but I do
                and I'm proud of you because of that ‚ù§.
                I would like to get you a present on this christmas but you'll again probs say "don't 
                spend any money on me" so yea
                I have a limited choice haha. That's why I'm making this site and doing it in november
                so I can think of some thing I can a add and make it a bit better. For now the site looks
                like shit so I hope I can make it look better by christmas heh.
                Btw I should mention it is mainly for you Reze but also since it's christmas it's also for
                everyone there. For now I met Megan, Amber, Amy and Aiko (yes, yes Princess-Aiko I know lol).
                Also there are some I didn't meet but know of like Alisa, Sarah or Blank (sorry if I forgot any).
                Since I know them I also want to wish you happy christmas and to not make yours and  Reze's life
                miserable. That's not important today tho, what's important is that I could make this 
                site for you and maybe spend a bit of time together. So again happy christmas to all of you.
                One thing I want to say specifically to Reze (mby first time in life lol) love ya ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ :3.
                Take care of yourself and have a decent day lol. <3<3<3<3<3<3.

                Today I made: top of the website, changelog, background and timer<br>
                [16.11.2024] 1 day after we got together :3, it was nice day :)<br>
                Added first row (reasons, music, how long we are together) and letter  <br>
                [22.11.2024] I don't know what to add more üòê. Added snowing animation, changed 
                website so it doesn't look like unicorn's vomit, some visual changes and sections
                for Reze, Amber and Megan.
